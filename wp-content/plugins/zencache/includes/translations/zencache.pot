This is a way for advanced site owners to work around concurrency limits in popular browsers; i.e., making it possible for browsers to download many more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster overall completion time. In short, this tells the browser that your website will not be overloaded by concurrent requests, because static resources are in fact being served by a content-delivery network (i.e., multiple CDN host names).
