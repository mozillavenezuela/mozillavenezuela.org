== Documentation ==

The built in template can be overridden by files within your template.

= Default vs. Custom Templates =

The Image Widget comes with a default template for the widget output. If you would like to alter the widget display code, create a new folder called "image-widget" in your template directory and copy over the "views/widget.php" file.

Edit the new file to your hearts content. Please do not edit the one in the plugin folder as that will cause conflicts when you update the plugin to the latest release.

New in 3.2: You may now also use the "sp_template_image-widget_widget.php" filter to override the default template behavior for .php template files. Eg: if you wanted widget.php to reside in a folder called my-custom-templates/ and wanted it to be called my-custom-name.php:

`add_filter('sp_template_image-widget_widget.php', 'my_template_filter');
function my_template_filter($template) {
	return get_template_directory() . '/my-custom-templates/my-custom-name.php';
}`

= Filters =

There are a number of filters in the code that will allow you to override data as you see fit. The best way to learn what filters are available is always by simply searching the code for 'apply_filters'. But all the same, here are a few of the more essential filters:

*widget_title*

This is actually a pretty typical filter in widgets and is applied to the widget title.

*widget_text*

Another very typical widget filter that is applied to the description body text. This filter also takes 2 additional arguments for $args and $instance so that you can learn more about the specific widget instance in the process of filtering the content.

*image_widget_image_attachment_id*

Filters the attachment id of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_url*

Filters the url of the image displayed in the widget.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.
THIS IS DEPRECATED AND WILL EVENTUALLY BE DELETED

*image_widget_image_width*

Filters the display width of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_height*

Filters the display height of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_maxwidth*

Filters the inline max-width style of the image. Hint: override this to use this in responsive designs :)
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.
Return null to remove this css from the image output (defaults to '100%').

*image_widget_image_maxheight*

Filters the inline max-height style of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.
Return null to remove this css from the image output (defaults to null)

*image_widget_image_size*

Filters the selected image 'size' corresponding to WordPress registered sizes.
If this is set to 'tribe_image_widget_custom' then the width and height are used instead.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_align*

Filters the display alignment of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_alt*

Filters the alt text of the image.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_link*

Filters the url that the image links to.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_link_target*

Filters the link target of the image link.
Accepts additional $args and $instance arguments.

*image_widget_image_attributes*

Filters a list of image attributes used in the image output. Similar to 'wp_get_attachment_image_attributes'
Accepts $instance arguments

*image_widget_link_attributes*

Filters a list of attributes used in the image link. Similar to 'wp_get_attachment_image_attributes'
Accepts $instance arguments
