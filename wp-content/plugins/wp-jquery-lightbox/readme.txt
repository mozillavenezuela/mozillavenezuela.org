A drop-in replacement for Lightbox 2 and similar plugins, shedding the bulk of Prototype and Scriptaculous. Improved for mobile devices.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you keep [the awesome Lightbox 2](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/)-functionality, but sheds the bulk of the Prototype Framework **and** Scriptaculous Effects Library.

Warren Krewenki [ported Lightbox to jQuery](http://warren.mesozen.com/jquery-lightbox/) and this plugin is mostly a wrapper to his work: providing localization support, an admin panel for configuration, (optional) auto-boxing of your image links and support for [WordPress galleries](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode), *including* [media library](http://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Library_SubPanel) titles and captions. 

This version is also [adjusted for mobile devices](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-jquery-lightbox/screenshots/);

* Swipe gestures for flicking between images on touch devices
* Improved scaling *maximizes* use of screen space
* Live adjustment to the browser window and orientation of your phone

See the plugin in action here: [http://game.hgo.se/blog/motion-capture/](http://game.hgo.se/blog/motion-capture/)

You can browse images with your keyboard: Arrows, P(revious)/N(ext) and X/C/ESC for close.

* or [sign up to RealPlayer Cloud using my referral link](https://cloud.real.com/r/UzKHSP) - we both get 1GB extra for free! 
* get me anything from [my Amazon whislisth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2QB6SQ5XX2U0N/105-3209188-5640446?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x=11&y=10) (used items are OK!)

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

[Older changelogs moved here.](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-jquery-lightbox/changelog/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-jquery-lightbox`-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Check out the jQuery Lightbox-panel in your admin interface for usage details and configuration.

= How to Use: =
1. With [WordPress built-in gallery](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode): [`[gallery link="file"]`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode)	
1. All galleries in a post make a single slideshow. To create separate slideshows, use `group`: 

	`[gallery link="file" ids="1,2,3" group="mon"]`
	
	`[gallery link="file" ids="4,5,6" group="tue"]`

1. You can manually add a `rel="lightbox"` attribute to any link:

	`<a href="image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="my caption">image #1</a>`

	Note the use of title-attribute to set a caption
		
1. To manually group sets of related images, follow step 3 but additionally include a group name in the `rel` attribute:
	
	`<a href="image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>`
	
	`<a href="image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>`
	
	`<a href="image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>`

1. You can use the `data-download` attribute to set a custom download link:
	
	`<a href="image-medium.jpg" rel="lightbox" data-download="image-superlarge.jpg"> [...] </a>`
	
1. To *disable* lightboxing of an image link, just set any other rel-attribute: `rel="nobox"`
	
1. Keyboard support: Arrows, P(revious)/N(ext) and X/C/ESC for close. Swipe left / right on touch devices.

1. [Infinite-Scroll](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/infinite-scroll/) and similar "endless pages"-plugins should call `doLightbox();` whenever it loads new content. Check your plugin for a setting 
	named "callbacks" - code that is called after each new page is loaded. Add this line;
	`if(typeof doLightBox !== 'undefined' && typeof jQuery !== 'undefined'){
	   doLightBox();
	}`

1. On the server side you can apply lightbox to any content by running `jqlb_apply_lightbox($your_html_content, "any ID");` It returns a string with all image links lightboxed, grouped by `"any id"`.

= Trouble shooting: =
If you have problems with WP jQuery Lightbox, please make sure you try these steps before asking for help. If you ask for help and I find any of these steps would fix the problem, I will just link you back here to do the work yourself.

1. Make sure your site is not throwing any javascript errors. Use [your browsers javascript console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) to find out.

If you're running a custom theme:

1. Make sure you have [`wp_head();`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_head) just before the closing `</head>` tag of your theme, or you will break many plugins, which generally use this hook to reference JavaScript files. 

1. For the same reason, always have `wp_footer();` just before the closing `</body>` tag of your theme.

1. Many JavaScript optimizers, combiners, minifiers, etc. conflict with [`wp_localize_script`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script2), used to configure this plugin and many others.

* If you have problems with jQuery Lightbox; first disable all JavaScript-optimizing plugins. (Optimize Scripts, W3 Total Cache, WP Minify etc)

* If you develop JavaScript optimizers for WordPress, please play nice with the default API...

* [More info about this issue](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/122-worked-13-does-not-work-for-me?replies=19)

Lastly:

1. Disable all other plugins, one at a time. Try the lightbox between each.

1. Revert to the default theme. Did it help? Fix your theme.

1. Search the forums for similar symptoms. 

Still have problems? Post a link and describe what issue you're having, and tell us what of these steps you've already tried.

Still have problems? Post a link and describe what issue you're having, and tell us what of these steps you've already tried.

= Can the lightbox display the image description instead of the title? =
WP jQuery Lightbox grabs texts from three different HTML nodes;

1. `title`-attribute of link-to-image
1. `img` tag's `title` attribute (if 1 is empty)
1. `img` tag's `alt` attribute (if 1 and 2 is empty)
1. HTML content of `.gallery-caption` or `.wp-caption-text` (in that order)

Look at how the default TwentyTwelve theme uses these in its galleries and set up your theme so it outputs what you need in these places.

= I can see elements of my site through the overlay = 

It's a problem of [z-index](http://www.w3schools.com/Css/pr_pos_z-index.asp). Check [the z-index property](http://www.w3schools.com/Css/pr_pos_z-index.asp) for the problematic elements, and force them to be less than 100. (Thanks [dway](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-jquery-lightbox-title-captions-bug-found-solved-and-fix-proposed?replies=20#post-2052340)!)

= How do I add images to a post? =

[Inserting Images into Posts and Pages](http://codex.wordpress.org/Inserting_Images_into_Posts_and_Pages)

= How do I create a thumbnail gallery? =

Upload images to a post (see previous question) and use [WordPress' built-in gallery shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode): `[gallery link="file"]`

Note the `link="file"` - this is crucial! By default the gallery will link your humbnails to a page displaying your image. With `link="file"` the thumbnails links 
directly to the image files - allowing Lightbox to function.

= Must fade-in and animation of all *box-scripts be so slow? =

WP-jQuery Lightbox lets you configure the animation duration and disable image resizing from the admin panel. Set duration to 0 to disable animations entirely.

= For developers: =
1. Always have `wp_footer();` just before the closing `</body>` tag of your theme, or you will break many plugins, which generally use this hook to reference JavaScript files. 
1. Apply lightbox to any content by running `jqlb_apply_lightbox($your_content, "any ID");` It returns a string with all image links lightboxed, grouped by `"any id"`.
1. Many JavaScript optimizers, combiners, minifiers, etc. conflict with [`wp_localize_script`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script2), used to configure this plugin and many others.

= Can I help you in any way? =

Indeed you can! 

Translations and help with implementing them would be nice. A read through and comments on my WordPress API usage would also be most welcome, as I'm not really able to keep on top of the frequent WordPress releases anymore.

And of course; [a book or two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2QB6SQ5XX2U0N/105-3209188-5640446?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x) always brightens my day! (used ones are fine!)
